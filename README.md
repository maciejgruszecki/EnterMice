The interface allows the use of cheap and widely available PS/2 mice on an Enterprise computer.
Additionally, it allows direct connection of two Atari standard joysticks without additional adapters (including Autofire support).

EnterMice is based on solutions used in the BoxSoft mouse interface, which supports the Neos mouse (MSX protocol).
